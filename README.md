# ConcurrencyDotNet
A simple C# and F# concurrency project.
It showcases both good and bad async habbits, as well as evidencing danngerous coding that can lead to deadlocking or worse non-deterministic code.
The F# part is there to showcase the immutable features provided by the language, and how that ties nicely with async programming.
To use the console app, uncomment the various exericses (1 to 6) in Program.cs.
